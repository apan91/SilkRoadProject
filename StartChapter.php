			<p> SilkRoad chapters serve as the grassroots network of our organization that connects first world countries to developing countries. Many of our student leaders came to see the world with a broader perspective and served as leaders not only in their communities, but also internationally. We invite you to start a chapter to stand up for the billions of voiceless, marginalized, and vulnerable children around the world. 
</p>
			<p> Our organization runs and is empowered through your energy and passion to bring awareness to the issue. Share your creativity and ways to reach out and work together to create a brighter future. Your passion and curiosity will help create systematic changes. We hope that your chapter will evolve from a student group to a movement of call for action with creative ideas with powerful tools to transform communities.
